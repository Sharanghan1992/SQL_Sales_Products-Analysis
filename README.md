# SQL_Sales_Products-Analysis
This project contains a realistic 4-table sales dataset (Customers, Products, Stores, Sales) with 500+ rows in the fact table. The dataset was generated with realistic customer names, store names, and product details to simulate a retail sales environment.

I created a collection of SQL practice questions and solutions for MS SQL Server, ranging from beginner to advanced:

ðŸ”¹ Beginner: Basic filtering, sorting, and aggregations

ðŸ”¹ Intermediate: Joins, groupings, top-N analysis

ðŸ”¹ Advanced: Common Table Expressions (CTEs), CASE statements, window functions (RANK, LAG, running totals), and analytical queries

Key examples include:

- Top customers by spending
- Monthly sales trends with percentage growth
- Store performance classification (Above/Below Average)
- Top-selling product per store using window functions
- Customer segmentation with CASE expressions

This project is designed as a SQL practice ground for analysts and developers preparing for real-world analytics or technical interviews.
